<h2>About the Internet Connectome project</h2>

<p>
To provide superior user experience, many applications need to know a lot about the characteristics of 
the user's Internet
connection, such as bandwidth and latency. When the applications are peer-to-peer, i.e., with messages
flowing directly between users rather than through a server, it is important to estimate these 
speed and delay characteristics for potential connections <em>between users</em>.
An example of application where it is mostly the
connections between the users and the servers that matter is video on demand. The servers can tailor
the videos, adapting bit-rate and resolution to yield the most enjoyable experience possible given the
user's connection. Another example is given by multi-player games where one of the players in a party
will serve as the game host, offering his computer or game console as a temporary game server. In this
setting, the quality of the connection between the users in the same party (connecting to the same user-hosted
game server) will matter a lot more than the connection to the server. To help decide who to connect
with who without having to spend seconds on each potential pair of users, it would be very useful
to be able to <em>predict</em> latency between any pair of Internet addresses.
<br /><br />
However, the Internet, by its very nature, is particularly difficult to observe and measure as a whole.
First, the Internet is not under a central authority, but instead is composed of a rather ad-hoc assembly
of many sub-networks with different characteristics, each being cared for by different entities, all rather
reluctant to share their knowledge of their corner of the Internet. Second, the very scale of the Internet
is, in itself, a major (but not insuperable) obstacle to any comprehensive survey. Any effort to map the
topology of the Internet, measure its different local characteristics such as latency and bandwidth between
addresses, is
impossible to complete using a few computers or with the help of only a handful of volunteers.
<br /><br />
This is why crowd-sourcing our survey of the Internet (in a way we will discuss further in just a
moment) appears to be the only viable solution. By the individually small effort of a great number of
people, great things can be achieved! Indeed, as more volunteers from different locations in the world
join the survey, better and the more reliable data get collected data. The data will be made public
and available to researchers and developers anywhere in the world. Ultimately, the collected
data has the potential to benefit the whole Internet community, and our goal at
the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=27&lang=en">machine learning
lab</a> (LISA), at <a href="http://www.umontreal.ca">Université de Montréal</a> 
is to devise and train models that will predict internet latency between
pairs of Internet addresses, and thus help deliver, in the end, a better user experience for all kinds of
applications.
</p>

<h2>The Goals & the Means</h2>
<p>
As hinted in the introduction, the goal of the survey is to map the topology of the Internet as well as
measuring, as accurately as possible, the latency between any two end points of the Internet where
users could be. The topology (the way computers and routers are connected together) is to be
surveyed using the traceroute tool. The latency is to be estimated using two types of pings. The first
ping method is the classical ping that uses the ICMP protocol to estimate the round-trip time between
two computers, that is, the time a message takes to reach a remote destination and come back to the
sender. The second ping method is the non-traditional TCP ping that uses the TCP protocol to estimate
the time it takes to establish a TCP connection between the local host and the remote destination. Both
ping methods gather different type information, and both are useful in their own way.
<br /><br />
Volunteers can participate to the survey quite easily by going to our 
<a href="index.html">Internet survey web page</a> and by
launching a digitally-signed Java applet (the applet is digitally signed because it needs to access the
system-specific ping and traceroute commands). The applet will probe the topology of the Internet and
estimate the latency to a number of remote destinations as determined by our survey server. The survey
server determines which remote hosts will be probed by the volunteers in order to ensure a good
coverage of the Internet as well as reliable latency measures.
Volunteers are encouraged to let the applet run as long as possible. A user-configurable duty-cycle will
let the applet perform a series of probes at fixed intervals, thus letting the volunteer decide how much
of their bandwidth they are giving us. In any case, the probes are likely to have negligible impact on the
volunteers' connection, as the individual probes are not bandwidth intensive, necessitating only a few
hundred bytes each.
<br /><br />
The data is collected on the survey server at Université de Montréal and will be 
available under a <a href="license.txt">BSD
3 Clause</a> license. The data files will be in 
an easy to parse, text-only, format, and updated as more data are accumulated.
<br /><br />
Further, the volunteers are invited to register a nickname to have their contribution appear on the daily,
weekly, and monthly leaderboards of volunteers performing the most pings. The volunteers' nicknames are only 
collected internally in our server for leaderboard purposes; they will not appear in the distributed
data files.
</p>

<h2>An Open Approach</h2>
<p>
On a fundamental level, we, at the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=27&lang=en">LISA</a>, 
believe in the importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a>. We are
convinced that scientific knowledge, and the data it is based on, is to be open to all.
This is why the complete source code (both applet and server side) as well as the collected data are
available to all, to be used under Open Source and Open Data licenses, respectively. The source code is
to be found on our <a href="https://github.com/lisa-lab/pings">project's github page</a>, and all are invited
to have a look at it, comment, and
participate. The software is available under a <a href="license.txt">BSD 3 Clause</a> license, and contains bits
of software
from other people, such as the globe applet based on the work of the <a href="http://www.jhlabs.com/java/maps/proj/">
JH Labs java projection project</a>
(available under an Apache license) and MaxMind's GeoLite database and API for geolocation
(available under LGPL and BSD-like licences).
<br /><br />
We also believe in the importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open Data</a> for science.
One of the core components of science
(and experimental sciences in particular) is the reproducibility of experiments, which seems to be often
overlooked or treated quite lightly. In order to ensure wider cooperation from other researchers and the
reproducibility of our results, all the data we collect is available under an <a href="license.txt">BSD 3 Clause Like</a> open
data license, which grants the use of the data for any purpose, that is, everyone is free to use it to do
more research, to publish it, or rehash it as need be, as long as they comply with the license.
</p>

<h2>A Partnership</h2>
<p>
This project is part of the <a href="http://www.ubi.com">Ubisoft</a> / 
<a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">NSERC</a> industrial chair on Artificial Intelligence 
at the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/?lang=en">DIRO</a>,
<a href="http://www.umontreal.ca">Université de Montréal</a>. The National Science and Engineering
Research Council (NSERC) of Canada funds basic and applied research.
The chair, created by NSERC over a year ago (in March 2011), concentrates on the
applications of Machine Learning to the challenges brought by next-generation games. One such
challenge is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking_(video_games)">advanced match-making</a>, 
where the goal is to form two opposing teams such that players
in each team complement each other well, and such that the resulting teams' strengths are as balanced
as possible, in order to maximize all of the players' fun during the game &ndash; everyone wants a good fight!
The current project of mapping the Internet and estimating latency between players is motivated by 
the desire to take estimated latency between players into account when forming teams.
You can learn
more about the industrial chair <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Chairholders-TitulairesDeChaire/Chairholder-Titulaire_eng.asp?pid=436">here</a>.
<br /><br />
However, the partnership isn't limited to Ubisoft and Université de Montréal: having the complete
project under Open Source and Open Data licenses allows any volunteer to join us and participate in
the project! So, if you are interested in participating to the code base or have ideas on how to use the
collected data, you can <a href="mailto:iconnectome@googlegroups.com">contact us</a>.
